        <h2 style="font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;color: orange;">Naruto:</h2>

        In the gif above you see a man with orange hair, his name is Yahiko (Yah-He-Koh) dying, as a sacrfice in his best friends arms, Nagato.
        Nagato, then goes on to become one of the most powerful villians throughout the entire Naruto Shippuden series known as Pain. Using a power called Rennegan Nagato CONTROLS
        Yahiko's body, yes his best friend's body, as well as 5 other bodies, and he can use the previous bodies powers! Crazy concept to grasp, I know, I know, but if you're into 
        binge watching tv's, because Naruto does have 903 episodes between 3 different series. It's my #1 favorite anime show for a reason, it will not disappoint, I can promise that!

        <p style="font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;color: rgb(0, 255, 0);">
        Attack On Titan also on my top 5 list of favorite animes. Above is a scene of Eren Yeager traveling back in time to talk to his father to change history. Eren is the 
        protagonist and antagonist of the show. Yeah that's right! Both the good guy and the villian! And goes on to WIPE OUT 80% of all population in his 4 season anime series!
        Absolutely amazing show! Not for the weak stomacher's (is that even a word? lol) it is pretty gory, as a lot of deaths, a lot of war. The storyline is just pure 
        gold, great character development, action the whole time.

        <h2 style="font-family: Cambria, Cochin, Georgia, Times, 'Times New Roman', serif;color: indigo;">Tokyo Ghoul:</h2>

        Tokyo Ghoul was the first anime I watched when I first started getting back into anime after being a kid. It has a special place in my heart. If you're ever feeling down, 
        down in slumps, life is kicking you a**. Watch Tokyo Ghoul, only the first 2 seasons. I promise those 2 seasons you will watch it on repeat. Kaneki from the gif above will
        become an inspiration to you. That show and Kaneki taught me grit. The gif is Kaneki unleashing his full power about to go It's crazy what a tv show can do for you while you're down in dumps, and this show, and anime was just that
        for me. It's part of the reason why I love these shows I shared on this page. Because of the emotions I felt in the exact moments I shared in the gifs of the show.
